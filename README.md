# Zigma

Front end code for the mobile application Zigma. The application aims to centralize the academic second hand book market. The application has a backend written in python that can be seen <a href="https://github.com/MaxSoneback/zigma_backend">here</a>. This app was part of my Bachelor's dissertation. I did my Bachelor's together with 3 other students and I wrote this front-end code together with another student in the group. The written report can be seen <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lk4jB3CGp-qNCF8cmt3Q9mb096kyVTkO/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
