# Zigma
Frontend code for the mobile app Zigma. The application aims to centralize the academic second hand book market. The frontend is written in Flutter/Dart. The application has a backend written in Django/Django channels together with Microsoft Azure and can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ajamlou/Zigma-backend">here</a>. The application was part of my bachelor's dissertation, together with three other students. My head responsibility was UX design - where I developed the interface fo the application (without functionalities) - and backend development, where I focused on modelling the database and creating the API. The bachelor thesis can be seen <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lk4jB3CGp-qNCF8cmt3Q9mb096kyVTkO/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
